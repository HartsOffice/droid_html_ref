stands for Hyper Text Markup Lanuage, and is not a programming lanuage
but more of a layout lanuage that describes to a browser how the
document or web page should be formatted.<br><br>HTML can be edited by
anything that can change text, although I would not recommend a full
blow word processor since they have markeup lanuage in their documents
and they might be copied over when you get ready to make your web page.
&nbsp;Some good editors are Notepad, &nbsp;Kompozer, and Geany (for
Linux).<br><br>Once you are ready to save your HTML make sure that you
put the .html extention on the end of your file name. &nbsp;For some
editors like Kompozer it will do this for you.<br><br>This app is meant
to be a quick reference, while I do wish to write a full book it will
take time and I will turn this into a book over a period of rolling
releases of this application.<br><br>If there is anything I need to change or add please email me at:<br>michael.webdev@gmail.com<br><br>And please be patient as I add content and additional examples to this application.<br><br>Thanks!<br>Michael Hart<br><br></body></html>
